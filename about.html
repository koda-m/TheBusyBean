        <p>Welcome to The Busy Bean, your neighborhood spot for handcrafted coffee, delicious pastries, and a warm, inviting atmosphere. Our story began with a simple passion: bringing people together over a great cup of coffee.<br/><br/>
		At The Busy Bean, we believe that coffee is more than just a drink—it’s an experience. That’s why we carefully source our beans from sustainable farms, roast them to perfection, and craft each cup with care. Whether you’re here to grab your morning espresso, catch up with friends, or get lost in a good book, we’re here to make every sip special.<br/><br/>
		Our cozy space is designed to be a home away from home, where locals and travelers alike can gather, work, or simply relax. We take pride in our friendly baristas, who are always happy to recommend a new brew or whip up your favorite latte just the way you like it.<br/><br/>
		Thank you for being part of our journey. We can’t wait to serve you your next cup!<br/><br/>
		Come visit us at our cozy downtown location or follow us on Instagram to stay up to date on new brews and community events!</p>

	<h2>Our Ingredients</h2>
	<div class="ingredients">
		<p>At The Busy Bean, we believe that great coffee starts with great ingredients. That’s why we carefully source our coffee beans from Fair Trade-certified farms, ensuring that every cup supports sustainable practices and fair wages for farmers. Our beans are hand-selected from some of the best coffee-growing regions, then roasted to perfection for a smooth, rich flavor.<br/><br/>
		We’re also committed to supporting our local community by using fresh, locally sourced ingredients whenever possible. From the milk in your latte to the pastries on our shelves, we partner with nearby farms and artisans to bring you the highest-quality, seasonal flavors.<br/><br/>
		Every sip and every bite at The Busy Bean is a reflection of our dedication to ethical sourcing, sustainability, and community support.</p>
